This is a readme file for 0x14-bit_manipulation project.
Bit manipulation helped me understand how to perfom operations of individual bits of binary numbers.

0-binary_to_uint.c
This will write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1-print_binary.c
This code writes a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2-get_bit.c
This piece of code writes a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3-set_bit.c
This code writes a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4-clear_bit.c
This code writes a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5-flip_bits.c
This code writes a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

100-get_endianness.c
This code writes a function that checks the endianness.

101-password
This code writes a code that finds the password for file
